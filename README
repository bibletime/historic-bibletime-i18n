This is the package which contains the translations of BibleTime.
See also the file INSTALL from the BibleTime program package.

Installation
--------------
You can install this package by executing
	
		./configure --prefix=<KDE3 prefix>
		make
		make install

This should install the translations of the user-interface, the Bible study
howto and of the handbook.


Debian specifics
---------------------------
Debian (and possibly derived distros as well) use a non-standard path to
store the documentation of KDE programs. Therefore the ./configure line above in
this case needs to be changed to:

kde_htmldir=/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML ./configure --prefix=/usr

If you forget this, you'll likely not be able to access the handbook and the
BibleStudy HowTo.
