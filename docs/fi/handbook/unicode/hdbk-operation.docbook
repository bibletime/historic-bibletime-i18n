The little "Mag" window below the Bookshelf is used to display extra information that is embedded in documents. When you move your mouse over a footnote marker, for example, then the Mag will display the actual content of the footnote. The toolbar gives you quick access to important functions, and the Desk on the right side is where you do your real work.</para>

<para

<tip
><para
>A neat side-effect of this feature is that it enables you to search for all places where a certain word in the greek or hebrew text occurs, and study the usage of that word. E.g., if you want to look for all occurrences of the word "oikos" (house) in the New Testament, first locate a verse where the word "oikos" is found (search for "house" in the New Testament). Find out the Strong's number of "oikos", which in this case is "G3624". Then you can limit your search to Strong's numbers, and search for "G3624". You will find all verses where this word is found in the original greek text.</para
